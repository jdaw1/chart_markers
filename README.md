# Chart Markers #
 
Start by marvelling at the 
[gallery](Documentation/ChartMarkers_Gallery.md), then read the 
[description](Documentation/ChartMarkers_Description.md). 
There is technical comment about the SVG 
[code](Documentation/ChartMarkers_Code.md), 
and an explanation of the available 
[files](Documentation/ChartMarkers_Files.md). 
Finally, a page about how to 
[grumble](Documentation/ChartMarkers_Grumbles.md) 
about a marker&rsquo;s design, and how not to grumble.

Charts in financial markets are a mess: $ or &euro; or &pound; or &yen; might be represented by different symbols on different charts. 
Indeed, sometimes different symbols in charts created by the same author and appearing on the same page.

A consistent set of markers would allow readers to focus more on the meaning of the data, and less on the distraction of attempting to decode the markers. 
Alas, many flags have details that are too small (e.g., 
[US](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_the_United_States), 
[CN](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_China), 
[HK](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_Hong_Kong), 
[MX](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_Mexico), 
[BR](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_Brazil), 
[EU](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_Europe)), or are not sufficiently different 
([IE](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_Ireland) &asymp; 
[IT](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_Italy) &asymp; 
[FR](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_France) &asymp; 
[RO](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_Romania) &asymp; 
[BE](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_Belgium) &asymp; 
[MD](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_Moldova)), 
or are asymmetrical so the centre = the datapoint isn&rsquo;t both obvious and unique 
([Nordics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nordic_cross_flag), 
[TW](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_Taiwan), 
[MY](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_Malaysia), 
[ZA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_South_Africa), 
[CL](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_Chile), 
[UY](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_Uruguay), 
[BH](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_Bahrain), 
[QA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_Qatar)), 
or have much white at the edge 
([JP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_Japan), 
[ID](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_Indonesia), 
[SG](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_Singapore), 
[IL](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_Israel), 
[PL](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_Poland), 
[BG](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_Bulgaria), 
[SK](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_Slovakia), 
[SI](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_Slovenia), 
[CY](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_Cyprus)).

**So a set of markers has been made, showcased in the [gallery](Documentation/ChartMarkers_Gallery.md)**.

If you and you alone use it, then you would be consistent for your readers: a good thing. 
If others also use it, it would be even easier for your readers: even better.

## <a name="draft"></a>Draft until April 2023 ##

Until Friday 31st March 2023 this set of markers is deemed to be in draft form. 
Until then, for a change to happen, the standard is only that &ldquo;*the proposed new be better than the old*&rdquo;. 
Please do suggest possible improvements in an [issue](https://github.com/jdaw1/chart_markers/issues/), and do so before this deadline.

For [issues](https://github.com/jdaw1/chart_markers/issues/) raised after Friday 31st March 2023 the standard toughens: &ldquo;*the proposed new must be better than the old, and better by a margin large enough to justify that there be any change at all*&rdquo;. 
That is, post draft, there will be a reluctance to make changes.

It is intended that [issues](https://github.com/jdaw1/chart_markers/issues/) raised by Friday 31st March 2023 will be processed (rejected, or accepted and implemented) by the end of the Easter weekend, so by Monday 10th April 2023 (intended, not quite promised). 
When that work is complete: these draft-period notices will be removed; pointers from the documentation to closed issues will be removed; and (it is intended) subsequent changes will be infrequent.
