# Chart Markers
 
Start by marvelling at the 
[gallery](Documentation/ChartMarkers_Gallery.md), then read the 
[description](Documentation/ChartMarkers_Description.md). 
There is technical comment about the SVG 
[code](Documentation/ChartMarkers_Code.md), 
and an explanation of the available 
[files](Documentation/ChartMarkers_Files.md). 
Finally, a page about how to 
[grumble](Documentation/ChartMarkers_Grumbles.md) 
about a marker&rsquo;s design, and how not to grumble.

Charts in financial markets are a mess: $ or &euro; or &pound; or &yen; might be represented by different symbols on different charts. 
Indeed, sometimes different symbols in charts created by the same author and appearing on the same page.

A consistent set of markers would allow readers to focus more on the meaning of the data, and less on the distraction of attempting to decode the markers. 
Such a set of markers has been made, showcased in the [gallery](Documentation/ChartMarkers_Gallery.md).

If you and you alone use it, then you would be consistent for your readers: a good thing. 
If others also use it, it would be even easier for your readers: even better.
