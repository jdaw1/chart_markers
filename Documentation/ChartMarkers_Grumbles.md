## <a name="draft"></a>Draft until April 2023 ##

Until Friday 31st March 2023 this set of markers is deemed to be in draft form. 
Until then, for a change to happen, the standard is only that &ldquo;*the proposed new be better than the old*&rdquo;. 
Please do suggest possible improvements in an [issue](https://github.com/jdaw1/chart_markers/issues/), and do so before this deadline.

For [issues](https://github.com/jdaw1/chart_markers/issues) raised after Friday 31st March 2023 the standard toughens: &ldquo;*the proposed new must be better than the old, and better by a margin large enough to justify that there be any change at all*&rdquo;. 
That is, post draft, there will be a reluctance to make changes.

It is intended that [issues](https://github.com/jdaw1/chart_markers/issues) raised by Friday 31st March 2023 will be processed (rejected, or accepted and implemented) by the end of the Easter weekend, so by Monday 10th April 2023 (intended, not quite promised). 
When that work is complete, these draft-period notices will be removed, and subsequent changes will be infrequent.

# Grumbles #

## <a name="issues"></a>Issues ##

All grumbles, complaints, suggestions, actually competent ideas for improvements, praise and indeed any other communication, should be in the form of an [issue](https://github.com/jdaw1/chart_markers/issues). 
Emails sent that are not credibly offering much money will be either ignored, or quoted in an issue. 
So please post that [issue](https://github.com/jdaw1/chart_markers/issues) yourself.


## <a name="overview"></a>Overview ##

These markers have been made fairly. 
Effort has been made to make each as good as possible, subject to the constraints, and without favouritism. 
Nonetheless, there might be grumbles. 
Some possible grumbles would be good and useful, but there are some hypothetical grumbles that would not be good and would not be welcome.


## <a name="perhaps_good"></a>Perhaps-good grumbles ##

* <a name="better_design"></a>Some possible grumbles might be about a better design. 
Does the candidate new design actually satisfy all the desiderata / constraints? 
Does it fit into the collection as a whole? 
Is it genuinely better? 
There is an advantage in consistency over time: is the improvement really enough to justify any change? 
If it passes all four, well done: the improvement might be accepted.

* <a name="error_detail"></a>There might be errors in details.
These errors might be mine, and might be in the used sources.
The errors might be about shades of colours, such as my not following the government&rsquo;s officially recommended RGB.
Or maybe the geometry of a flag detail is slightly misproportioned.
Please send a source that at least seems official, and if the error is serious enough to justify a change, there might be a change.

* <a name="missing_big"></a>Some possible grumbles might be about missing countries that should not be missing.
If the missing country has multiple billions of dollars of actively traded external debt, or multiple tens of billions of actively traded internal debt, then it should have a marker.

* <a name="missing_small"></a>Some possible grumbles might be about missing countries that are very small. 
Is there a genuine purpose to another marker, a genuine purpose that is not merely a ruse to justify your country having a marker? 
This is a tough standard: additional markers make it more difficult for things to be different &mdash; they occupy &lsquo;optical space&rsquo;. 
But if there is a genuine purpose, explain it.


## <a name="not_good"></a>Not-good grumbles ##

* <a name="missing_detail"></a>Some possible grumbles might be about a missing detail: *My great-&hellip;-great-grandfather fought at the battle represented by a particular detail of our heroic flag, and you are disrespecting his memory by omitting that detail.* 
Please don&rsquo;t be silly. 
It is omitted for a reason related to the constraints, most likely the one about there being little space in small markers.

* <a name="present_detail"></a>Some possible grumbles might be about present details: &ldquo;that symbol was used by a party or people of whom I disapprove&rdquo;. 
There have been lots of bad people, with lots of iconography: almost everything resembles something that is or was used by somebody bad ([e.g.](https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-2007-08-19-0708180225-story.html)). 
Further, we shouldn&rsquo;t allow baddies a *de facto* monopoly of any particular geometry. 
So such an argument is unlikely to be persuasive. 
If trying it anyway, include a suggestion of a better marker that satisfies the constraints, and that would generally be perceieved as non-partisan.


## <a name="awful_grumbles"></a>Awful grumbles ##

<a name="NnfycnfyceTiasmfcnm"></a>In theory, there could be grumbles that are really about competition between your country and its enemy. 
Please don&rsquo;t. 
Even if your country has an enemy, and even if that the enmity is important to you, such squabbles do not belong here. 
So the answer to all such requests and demands is and must be &ldquo;*No: not for your country, nor for your country&rsquo;s enemy. This is about standardised markers for charts, nothing else.*&rdquo; (&lsquo;*N:nfyc,nfyce.Tiasmfc,ne.*&rsquo;).

* <a name="awful_more_splendid"></a>E.g., there could be grumbles demanding that &ldquo;My country&rsquo;s marker must be much more splendid than that of my country&rsquo;s enemy.&rdquo; *N:nfyc,nfyce.Tiasmfc,ne.*

* <a name="awful_worse"></a>E.g., and similar to the previous but worse, there could be grumbles demanding that &ldquo;my country&rsquo;s enemy must have a less-good marker&rdquo;, or even that &ldquo;my country&rsquo;s enemy is not worthy of a marker&rdquo;. *N:nfyc,nfyce.Tiasmfc,ne.*

* <a name="awful_text"></a>E.g., and even worse than the previous, would be a demand that descriptive text supports the claims of your country, or denies the claims of your country&rsquo;s enemy. *N:nfyc,nfyce.Tiasmfc,ne.*

<a name="awful_not_here"></a>You and your enemy might both say [that](http://api.parliament.uk/historic-hansard/commons/1940/jun/04/war-situation#column_796): &ldquo;We shall fight on the beaches, we shall fight on the landing grounds, we shall fight in the fields and in the streets, we shall fight in the hills; we shall never surrender&rdquo;. 
But this is not a beach, nor a landing ground, nor a field, nor a street, nor a hill. 
This is not the place for the fight of your country versus its enemy.

<a name="awful_inconsistent"></a>Of course, because of the licence under which the markers are released, you could make and use your own version of these markers: your country extravagantly big and splendid; its enemies absent; neutrals punished for their neutrality. 
But please don&rsquo;t, as there is a public good in consistency.


## <a name="corporate_grumbles"></a>Corporate grumbles ##

Some of the markers are of entities that, though not sovereigns, have debt that in financial markets is often compared to that of sovereigns. 
These entities are generally companies, with corporate logos. 
In theory, perhaps, a silly employee could email a grumble along the lines of &ldquo;*Your marker does not precisely follow the design of our corporate logo, and we will sue if you don&rsquo;t&nbsp;&hellip;*&rsquo;. 
Save yourself effort: there would be no need write any additional words, as those would be enough to cause the delete button to be pressed. 
There is enough silliness in the world: please don&rsquo;t add to it. 
(And please file your grumble as an [issue](https://github.com/jdaw1/chart_markers/issues), so a broader audience can enjoy it.)

Instead, consider the need for simplicity, for memorability, for being distinctive (yours not necessarily being the most important marker using a particular colour scheme), for symmetry, etc. 
If you have a genuinely better suggestion meeting all the criteria, please suggest it non-threateningly and politely, in an [issue](https://github.com/jdaw1/chart_markers/issues).


## <a name="corporate_praise"></a>Corporate praise ##

The other direction is more noteworthy. 
It might be that you believe that my design would make a better corporate logo (in at least some cases, it would), and want to use it as such. 
Because of the licence under which released, I cannot stop you using it. 
Also, because of the licence under which released, you cannot stop others using it. 
But perhaps you can prevent others using it misleadingly or fraudulently&mdash;seek legal advice elsewhere.

Nonetheless, if you do use one of these designs or something based on it, note that they have taken much skill, skill which would not otherwise be financially rewarded. 
Hence you are hereby encouraged to gift to me a chunky fraction of what a new logo would otherwise have cost you.



## <a name="be_nice"></a>Be nice, be fair, accept decisions ##

Please, whatever the request, do ask nicely and politely. 
And then be respectful of decisions, even those that don&rsquo;t go your way.

<a name="NB"></a>*NB*:

* <a name="disagreement"></a>My disagreement with a suggestion about the marker for a country does not imply that I disapprove of that country or its behaviour; it means only that I disagree with the suggestion about the marker.

* <a name="agreement"></a>Likewise, my agreement with a suggestion about the marker for a country does not imply that I approve of that country or its behaviour; it means only that I agree with the suggestion about the marker.
